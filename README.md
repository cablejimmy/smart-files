# Smart Files

A better folder orginization system.

Hierarchy Template.zip includes a basic template of otherwise empty nested folders.

"Inbox" is for active files, downloads, and shortcuts.

"Library" is for storage of raw files.

"Projects" is for project skeleton files and shortcuts to relevant raw files.
